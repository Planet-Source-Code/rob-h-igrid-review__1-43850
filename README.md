### Source Code

```
Just to let everyone know. Since the Comments I left on the IGrid Original Review Where DELETED!
The IGrid is based on the SGrid from VBAccelerator!
Don't Buy the IGrid control. Download It from VBAcellerator.com and ammend It your self.
To the Author Of IGrid:
DON'T DELETE COMMENTS. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS!!!!
```
